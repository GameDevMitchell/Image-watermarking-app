- **Save Image**: After adding the watermark, click "Save Image" to save the watermarked image to your computer.
  
  After clicking "Save Image", a file dialog will prompt you to select a location and enter a filename to save the watermarked image. Once you confirm the save location and filename, the image will be saved as a PNG file.

  A confirmation message will then display, indicating that the image has been successfully saved. Then the new image pops up.
